**** Start out with the nerdy/rifftrax niche
- Start out with this crowd, don't put ads on it at first so we get that strong base.
  - Think if the freemium parts are useful at this point.
  - When it starts getting ground, move the features into paid.
  - Also allow people to remove ads for money too, which is dumb cause ad block plus but yeah...
    - Maybe make it as a Reddit Gold idea ish.
- Then slowly start add ads, but only cool ads at first like Rifftrax or reddit or something nerdy.
- Then expand and start targeting a larger audience, and start integrating more things.
  - Like the amazon streaming affiation and netflix.
